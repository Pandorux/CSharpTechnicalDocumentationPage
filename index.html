                <p>
                    C# (pronounced "See Sharp") is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language. C# enables developers to build many types of 
                    secure and robust applications that run in the .NET ecosystem. C# has its roots in the C family of languages and will be immediately familiar to C, C++, 
                    Java, and JavaScript programmers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Several C# features help create robust and durable applications. 
                        
                    <ul>
                        <li>Garbage collection automatically reclaims memory occupied by unreachable unused objects.</li>
                        <li>Nullable types guard against variables that don't refer to allocated objects.</li>
                        <li>Exception handling provides a structured and extensible approach to error detection and recovery.</li>
                        <li>Lambda expressions support functional programming techniques.</li>
                        <li>Language Integrated Query (LINQ) syntax creates a common pattern for working with data from any source.</li>
                        <li>Language support for asynchronous operations provides syntax for building distributed systems.</li>
                        <li>C# has a unified type system. All C# types, including primitive types such as int and double, inherit from a single root object type.</li>
                        <li>All types share a set of common operations.</li>
                        <li>Values of any type can be stored, transported, and operated upon in a consistent manner. Furthermore, C# supports both user-defined reference types and value types.</li>
                        <li>C# allows dynamic allocation of objects and in-line storage of lightweight structures.</li>
                        <li>C# supports generic methods and types, which provide increased type safety and performance.</li>
                        <li>C# provides iterators, which enable implementers of collection classes to define custom behaviors for client code.</li>
                    </ul> 
                    
                    C# emphasizes versioning to ensure programs and libraries can evolve over time in a compatible manner. Aspects of C#'s design that 
                    were directly influenced by versioning considerations include the separate virtual and override modifiers, the rules for method 
                    overload resolution, and support for explicit interface member declarations.

                    This guide assumes you have the following back background:

                    <ul>
                        <li>blah blah</li>
                        <li>blah blah blah blah</li>
                        <li>Some programming experience with a sequential coding language like Python, or a visual coding language like Scratch.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

            <section class="main-section" id="programming_environment_setup">
                <h1>Programming Environment Setup</h1>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="hello_world">
                <h1>Hello World</h1>
                <code>Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");</code>
                <p>
                    Congratulations! You've run your first C# program. It's a simple program that prints the message "Hello World!". It used the 
                    Console.WriteLine method to print that message. Console is a type that represents the console window. WriteLine is a method 
                    of the Console type that prints a line of text to that text console.
                    <br>
                    Let's move on and explore more. The rest of this lesson explores working with the string type, which represents text in C#. 
                    Like the Console type, the string type has methods. The string methods work with text.
