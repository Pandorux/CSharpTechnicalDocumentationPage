                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>
                    C# (pronounced "See Sharp") is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language. C# enables developers to build many types of 
                    secure and robust applications that run in the .NET ecosystem. C# has its roots in the C family of languages and will be immediately familiar to C, C++, 
                    Java, and JavaScript programmers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Several C# features help create robust and durable applications. 
                        
                    <ul>
                        <li>Garbage collection automatically reclaims memory occupied by unreachable unused objects.</li>
                        <li>Nullable types guard against variables that don't refer to allocated objects.</li>
                        <li>Exception handling provides a structured and extensible approach to error detection and recovery.</li>
                        <li>Lambda expressions support functional programming techniques.</li>
                        <li>Language Integrated Query (LINQ) syntax creates a common pattern for working with data from any source.</li>
                        <li>Language support for asynchronous operations provides syntax for building distributed systems.</li>
                        <li>C# has a unified type system. All C# types, including primitive types such as int and double, inherit from a single root object type.</li>
                        <li>All types share a set of common operations.</li>
                        <li>Values of any type can be stored, transported, and operated upon in a consistent manner. Furthermore, C# supports both user-defined reference types and value types.</li>
                        <li>C# allows dynamic allocation of objects and in-line storage of lightweight structures.</li>
                        <li>C# supports generic methods and types, which provide increased type safety and performance.</li>
                        <li>C# provides iterators, which enable implementers of collection classes to define custom behaviors for client code.</li>
                    </ul> 
                    
                    C# emphasizes versioning to ensure programs and libraries can evolve over time in a compatible manner. Aspects of C#'s design that 
                    were directly influenced by versioning considerations include the separate virtual and override modifiers, the rules for method 
                    overload resolution, and support for explicit interface member declarations.

                        <li>blah blah blah blah</li>
                        <li>Some programming experience with a sequential coding language like Python, or a visual coding language like Scratch.</li>
