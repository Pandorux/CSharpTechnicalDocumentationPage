                <p>
                    C# (pronounced "See Sharp") is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language. C# enables developers to build many types of 
                    secure and robust applications that run in the .NET ecosystem. C# has its roots in the C family of languages and will be immediately familiar to C, C++, 
                    Java, and JavaScript programmers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Several C# features help create robust and durable applications. 
                        
                    <ul>
                        <li>Garbage collection automatically reclaims memory occupied by unreachable unused objects.</li>
                        <li>Nullable types guard against variables that don't refer to allocated objects.</li>
                        <li>Exception handling provides a structured and extensible approach to error detection and recovery.</li>
                        <li>Lambda expressions support functional programming techniques.</li>
                        <li>Language Integrated Query (LINQ) syntax creates a common pattern for working with data from any source.</li>
                        <li>Language support for asynchronous operations provides syntax for building distributed systems.</li>
                        <li>C# has a unified type system. All C# types, including primitive types such as int and double, inherit from a single root object type.</li>
                        <li>All types share a set of common operations.</li>
                        <li>Values of any type can be stored, transported, and operated upon in a consistent manner. Furthermore, C# supports both user-defined reference types and value types.</li>
                        <li>C# allows dynamic allocation of objects and in-line storage of lightweight structures.</li>
                        <li>C# supports generic methods and types, which provide increased type safety and performance.</li>
                        <li>C# provides iterators, which enable implementers of collection classes to define custom behaviors for client code.</li>
                    </ul> 
                    
                    C# emphasizes versioning to ensure programs and libraries can evolve over time in a compatible manner. Aspects of C#'s design that 
                    were directly influenced by versioning considerations include the separate virtual and override modifiers, the rules for method 
                    overload resolution, and support for explicit interface member declarations.

                <p>
                    This guide assumes you have the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>That you have already setup your IDE for C# development</li>
                    <li>That you have some programming experience with a sequential coding language like Python, or a visual coding language like Scratch.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="hello_world">
                <h1>Hello World</h1>
                <p>To start off, write the following line of code in the main function of your IDE and then execute the code.</p>
                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");</code>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Congratulations! You've run your first C# program. It's a simple program that prints the message "Hello World!". It used the 
                    Console.WriteLine method to print that message. Console is a type that represents the console window. WriteLine is a method 
                    of the Console type that prints a line of text to that text console.
                    <br>
                    Let's move on and explore more. The rest of this lesson explores working with the string type, which represents text in C#. 
                    Like the Console type, the string type has methods. The string methods work with text.

            <section class="main-section" id="declaring_and_using_variables">
                <h1>Declaring and Using Variables</h1>
                <p>
                    Now that we can print messages to the console, we use that existing knowledge to learn and understand variables in C#. Lets start off by 
                    declaring a variable and then print it using the console.
                </p>
                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>int i = 3;</code>
                    <code>Console.WriteLine("This number is " + i);</code>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Nice! Our program remembered that we assigned 3 to the variable i when we printed it in the console. Variables allows us to store a variety
                    of information we use later in our program from simple numbers to giant tables of information. We can also change this information as we see 
                    fit. Try out the code below to see what it does.
                </p>
                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>int i = 7;</code>
                    <code>i = 15;</code>
                    <code>Console.WriteLine("What is my number? " + i);</code>
                    <code>i = 23;</code>
                    <code>Console.WriteLine("And What is my number now? " + i);</code>
                </div>
                <p>
                    It is pretty easy to change the value of our i variable as we see fit as long as it is being assigned a number. As C# is a strongly-typed
                    programming language we need to be explicit about what type of data is stored in our variables. In C#, if you assigned a value to a 
                    variable that does not match the variable type then C# will throw an error. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We'll get go over several of the data types C# has in the next section.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="data_types">
                <h1>Data Types</h1>
                <p>
                    Due to C# being a strongly-typed programming language we need to specify the type of data each vairable we declare will use. Remember if you assign data 
                    to a variable that does not have a matching type then the compiler will throw an error. You can a short list of common data types below.
                </p>
                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>// Booleans are variables that can only be true or false</code>
                    <code>// They're really useful for if statements and loops!</code>
                    <code>boolean b = true;</code>
                    <code></code>
                    <code>string s = "Strings store text!";</code>
                    <code></code>
                    <code>// Ints hold whole numbers</code>
                    <code>int i = 3;</code>
                    <code></code>
                    <code>// Floats can hold whole and frational numbers</code>
                    <code>float f = 3.2345f;</code>
                </div>
                <p>
                    You can find a more extensive list of data types within <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/built-in-types">Microsoft's C# Documentation</a>.
                    Once you start learning about loops and functions you will learn about collections of data as well.
